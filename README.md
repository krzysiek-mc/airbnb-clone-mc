## Airbnb-clone project

This mini course is led by Micha≈Ç Matczuk and it's created to learn good practise of writing code.

---

To run our project on your computer, first you should clone all files from this github repository and then on terminal you should run one of the following commands:

- `yarn start --android`
- `yarn start --ios` # you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to do iOS development without a Mac
- `yarn start --web`
